KEEPTRACK

When I get home from work, I like to freshen up with a 10 minute nap. These naps often
turn into 1 hour naps. I built this app to keep track of the timers I set.

I don't think I've ever put this much conscious effort into maintaining a bad habit.

In addition to being a countdown timer, KeepTrack keeps track of when the timer was used
and displays them in a list overview.
